# Sentiment_Analysis

This project implements a sentiment analysis pipeline using Word2Vec embeddings and a Logistic Regression classifier. It begins by loading and preprocessing a dataset of sentences with associated sentiment labels. Preprocessing includes tokenizing text, removing stopwords, punctuation, and digits. Afterward, the project loads the pre-trained Google News Word2Vec model to convert each word into a 300-dimensional embedding. To create sentence-level features, it averages the word embeddings of each token in the sentence, resulting in a fixed-length feature vector for each sentence. These feature vectors are then split into training and testing sets, where a Logistic Regression classifier is trained to predict sentiment labels. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and a classification report, which includes precision, recall, and F1 scores. This project showcases an approach to text classification using word embeddings and machine learning.
